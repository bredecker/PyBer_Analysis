# PyBer_Analysis

##Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to review the ridesharing data provided to identify any dispareties and needs for the client. 

##Results
The rideshare data provided from our client for January 01, 2019 to April 28, 2019 was analyzed to create a better understanding of needs for three different types of cities; urban, suburban, and rural. The client also asked that we review the average fare per ride, and per driver, for each city type. By reviewing the data, trends suggest that fares are greater in rural areas due to less availability of drivers. In turn, urban areas having the greatest market saturation of drivers allows for lower fares, but also creates a lower average fare per driver due to the greater customer base. The most comprehensive chart that we created to display the overall data is titled PyBer_fare_summary.png, located in the PyBer_Analysis/Starter_Code folder.
